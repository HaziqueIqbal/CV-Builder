# CV-Builder
I have developed a CV-builder application using JavaScript to provide users with a seamless experience in creating their professional resumes. The application offers a user-friendly interface where individuals can easily sign up and access various features. Users have the freedom to create their CVs by entering their personal information, educational background, work experience, and skills. The application provides four available templates, allowing users to choose the design that best suits their preferences.

Once the CV is created, users can effortlessly update and modify the content as needed. The application ensures convenience by enabling users to generate a PDF version of their CV with a single click. This PDF format is highly versatile, making it easy for users to share their resumes with potential employers or download them for offline use. With its intuitive features, the CV-builder application simplifies the process of creating and managing professional CVs, empowering individuals to present their qualifications effectively in the job market.

Overall, the CV-builder application streamlines the process of CV creation and management. It offers flexibility, convenience, and customization options through different templates. By providing a seamless experience and the ability to generate PDF versions, the application empowers users to craft compelling resumes that effectively highlight their skills and experiences.
